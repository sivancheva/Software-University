        <p>We hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil.
            Everything we do is with and for love:
            love of our friends from around the world and the new friends we will meet in the university.
            We are a playful camp. We want to share great code with everyone who
            might journey to our desert jungle, and hopefully climb up our monkey trees to enjoy a banana.</p>
